        <li class="intro"><strong>Losing weight</strong> 
            <p>Losing weight is usually the most <strong>sustainable and the healthiest</strong> when it is done in a <storng>slow and steady</storng> manner. There are many methods to losing weight that have become popular in recent times. These methods include low carbohydrate/high fat diets, low fat/high carbohydrate diets, very low-calorie diets, and some others. However, the most sustainable and healthiest method to weight loss would be diets that <strong>reduce calories</strong>, but have the calories be made up of <strong>50% carbs</strong>, <strong>30% fats</strong>, with the rest of the calories coming from <strong>protein</strong> and plenty of green, leafy vegetables. Being in a deficit of <strong>500-1000 calories</strong> below your maintenance calories is the best way to promote weight loss.</p>
            <p>There are many online calculators that can tell you how many calories you’re supposed to be eating to lose, maintain, or gain weight. One that I’ve been using for a while now is the <strong>MyFitnessPal</strong> app. Apps or similar websites allow you to track the foods you eat throughout the day in order to ensure you’re eating the number of calories you’re supposed to be eating as well as your set <strong>macros</strong> (carbs, fats, and protein). Another helpful tip would be to weigh yourself every day around the same time and under the same circumstances (like in the morning after having used the bathroom). If you track your weight every day and then average out the weigh-ins for the week, you’ll get a better idea of how much weight you’re losing (it also helps you not get discouraged if you have a weigh-in that’s higher one day compared to earlier in the week).</p></li>
        <li><strong>Maintaining weight</strong> 
            <p>Many of the same principles apply here. Similar to the methods of losing weight, you can use an online calculator to find your <strong>maintenance calories</strong> and then adjust the calories if you’re noticing unwanted weight-loss/gain. Depending on your level of self-control, maintaining weight can be a little less strict and allow you more freedom in <strong>what you eat</strong> and <strong>how much you eat</strong>. You also don’t need to weigh yourself every day if you don’t want to. Random weigh-ins are fine, or you can judge this on how you’re looking in the mirror.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Gaining weight</strong> 
            <p>This should be done in a similar way to losing weight. At a <strong>slow and steady pace</strong>. Just like how you eat in a <strong>deficit</strong> of 500-1000 calories, you can eat in a <strong>surplus</strong> of 500-1000 calories as well. Although you can be much more relaxed in how much you eat over your set calories, you don’t want to <strong>overdo it</strong> (eating so much that it leads to rapid weight-gain). It would also be a good idea to track you weight closely to ensure that you’re gaining however much weight you want to be gaining, slowly.</p></li>
