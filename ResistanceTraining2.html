            <td>Should use 60-70% of a 1 rep max (RM) for 8-12 reps for 1-3 sets. You should strive to rest 2-3 minutes between sets. Try to take about 1-2 seconds to complete every rep.</td>
            <td>Should start with 60% of a 1RM for 3-6 reps for 3-6 sets. Rest about 3-5 minutes between sets. These movements should be explosive so try to do them quickly but controlled.</td>
            <td>Start with 70-85% of your 1RM for 8-12 reps for 1-3 sets. Rest 2-3 minutes between sets where you use heavier weights and 1-2 minutes between sets when you use lighter weights. Time under tension is important here so slower and controlled can help recruit muscle fibers and lead to a better contraction.</td>
            <td>Start with about 50% of your 1RM for more than 15 reps for at least 3 sets. Rest for 30-90 seconds between sets. Focus on volume and maintaining your form throughout the workout.</td>
