    <div class="information">
    <ul>
        <li class="intro"><strong>What is resistance training?</strong> 
            <p>Resistance training is the <strong>progressive</strong> use of a wide range of resistive loads, different methods of movement, and different methods of applying that resistance (weight machines, free weights like barbells and dumbbells, elastic bands, medicine balls and even bodyweight).</p></li>
        <li><strong>Why should I add resistance training?</strong> 
            <p>Beneficial for environmental quality of life, adding resistance training to your workout regimen (along with cardio) can result in <strong>significant reductions</strong> in peripheral and central diastolic blood pressure, increase in cardiorespiratory fitness, increase in upper and lower body strength, and increase in lean body mass. Resistance training yields <strong>greater benefits</strong> for weight loss and fat loss than aerobic and resistance training modalities. Implementing resistance training results in more <strong>power</strong>, <strong>strength</strong>, <strong>muscle size</strong>, <strong>balance</strong>, <strong>mobility</strong>, <strong>motor unit integrity and the preservation of these benefits</strong> as one reaches older age. The addition of resistance training may also help <strong>prevent injuries</strong> during sports participation.</p></li>
        <li><strong>What type of resistance training should I do?</strong> 
            <p>Determining what type of resistance training is right for you <strong>depends on your access</strong> to gyms, equipment, and of course, what you find the most enjoyable. Like cardio, it shouldnâ€™t result in injuries as long as you follow <strong>proper form and progress</strong> at a manageable rate.</p>
