        <li class="intro"><strong>Why should I do cardio?</strong> 
            <p>It’s been found that trying to improve your cardiovascular health can lead to a <strong>reduction</strong> in your <strong>resting heart rate and blood pressure</strong> which means your heart won’t have to work as hard throughout the day. There have also been studies that indicate that cardio can <strong>improve the functionality of the brain</strong>, <strong>improve joint health</strong>, <strong>improve</strong> the health of your <strong>skin</strong>, <strong>increase your workload</strong>, <strong>reduces</strong> the chance of developing <strong>type 2 diabetes</strong>, can <strong>reduce</strong> feelings of <strong>stress</strong>, can <strong>improve energy</strong> throughout the day and <strong>improve your sleep</strong> at the end of the day by <strong>encouraging REM sleep</strong>. Let’s not forget that cardio also burns calories meaning that it can help you with your diet by aiding in your <strong>caloric deficit</strong>.</p></li>
        <li><strong>HIIT vs. LISS</strong> 
            <p><strong>High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)</strong> is a form of cardio that involves short periods of high intensity anaerobic exercise with less intense periods of recovery. <strong>Low Intensity Steady State (LISS)</strong> is a form of cardio that involves doing aerobic activity at a low/moderate intensity for a continuous period of time. It’s been found that each have good things about them as well as bad things. Some people prefer HIIT workouts because they <strong>take less time</strong> to complete than LISS workouts and some may also find them more interesting. Some may prefer LISS workouts because they are usually <strong>less physically demanding</strong>, and they enjoy the time they take to do this form of cardio. Studies have shown that LISS is <strong>basically equivalent</strong> to LISS in untrained individuals and that mild interval training is <strong>similar in difficulty</strong> to HIIT. HIIT at a very high intensity was usually considered <strong>less enjoyable</strong> than LISS but both HIIT and LISS resulted in <strong>decreases in enjoyment</strong> over the course of weeks. Try to keep it varied and interesting. You could implement both forms of cardio into your training.</p></li>
        <li><strong>What cardiovascular exercises should I do?</strong> 
            <p>The answer to that question is pretty simple, if you have something in particular that you’re <strong>working towards</strong> (marathons, triathlons, etc.) then you’d want to do <strong>more of what you’re training for</strong>. If you’re doing cardio for the <strong>health benefits</strong> or to aid your <strong>caloric deficit</strong>, then you have a lot of options. The main thing to keep in mind is that it should be <strong>enjoyable</strong>, and it shouldn’t result in <strong>injuries</strong>.</p>
